    title: "Summit Bank Chooses ICSFS as Core Technology Partner",
    date: "July, 2025",
    summary:"Summit Bank announces the launch of its new digital banking platform, providing customers with enhanced online and mobile banking experiences.",
    content:`Abuja, Nigeria - July 2025: In a bold move, aimed at providing cutting-edge ethical and digital banking services, Summit Bank, Nigeria’s newest entrant into the non-interest banking space, has chosen ICS Financial Systems Ltd. (ICSFS), a global provider of next-generation universal banking software, as its core technology partner. The MOU signing ceremony took place at the ICSFS Centre of Excellence in Amman, Jordan, and was attended by senior executives from both organisations. From Summit Bank, Mr. Umar Ahmed, Chairman, and ED/COO, Dr. Mukhtar Adam, were joined by Business and Technical Advisors Mr. Meshack Ossai and Mr. Taiwo Akinde, respectively. On the ICSFS side, Mr. Robert Hazboun, Global CEO, Mr. Wael Malkawi, ED, and other senior leaders were in attendance.
    The partnership will enable Summit Bank to implement the ICS BANKS® ethical banking and digital banking solutions across its headquarters and six initial branches. The technology solution deployment aims to activate and accelerate the bank’s vision to be the leading ethical bank, supporting its stakeholders for common growth and prosperity while achieving this by being the trusted partner that empowers individuals and communities to make positive impact in the lives of stakeholders for a prosperous society.

The decision was made after a thorough evaluation process, and we are confident that the ICS BANKS® platform will serve as a solid foundation for delivering secure, customer-focused Islamic banking. Their expertise and understanding of Sharia compliance will help us contribute meaningfully to Nigeria’s economy and drive financial inclusion,” Mr. Ahmed said, while commenting on the development.

ICSFS has demonstrated exceptional transparency and technical expertise from day one. Their understanding of the Nigerian regulatory environment and ability to customize solutions to our specific needs gives us full confidence in this collaboration,” he said.
    On his part, Mr. Hazboun welcomed Summit Bank into the ICSFS client community while committing to supporting the bank effectively. “We are proud to support Summit Bank as it enters the Nigerian market with a modern, non-interest banking model.

    title: "Summit Bank Speculated to have Links with Zenith Bank",
    date: "August 3, 2025",
    summary: "Shortly after Summit Bank Ltd commenced operations, some media speculations emerged stating that the new non-interest bank may have close business connection with frontline commercial bank, Zenith Bank Plc.",
    content: `Shortly after Summit Bank Ltd commenced operations, some media speculations emerged stating that the new non-interest bank may have close business connection with frontline commercial bank, Zenith Bank Plc. Several reasons were evolved to buttress this possibility.
    The top reason was that Dr. Mukhtar Adam, Summit Bank’s Executive Director/Chief Operating Officer, left his seventeen years engagement at Zenith Bank, with the last six years as Group Chief Finance Officer (GCFO), before joining Summit Bank as Co-founder. The speculation, which kicked off with a story in The Nation, suggested a close relationship between the former Zenith GCFO and Jim Ovia, the Zenith Bank Chairman, and posited that Zenith Bank may have a hand in the emergence of Summit Bank.
    To strengthen the speculation, the narratives drew retrospective reflections that linked the emergence of older non-interest banks with commercial banks. For instance, the speculations linked the emergence of Jaiz Bank with First Bank, the emergence of Taj Bank with FCBM, and the emergence of Lotus Bank with GTB, all supported by the more established link between Sterling Bank and The Alternative Bank.
    Other reasons for the speculation included the Zenith Bank factor in the Summit Bank board. Umar Shuaib Ahmed, Summit Bank’s Chairman, served on the Board of Zenith Bank Plc as an Executive Director for six years. He also served as a non-Executive Director at Zenith Pensions Custodian Ltd. In addition, he served as the Group Supervising Director at Zenith Bank Sierra Leone. Aisha Bello, a non-Executive Director at Summit Bank, also served as Deputy General Manager at Zenith Bank. With these two added to Mukhtar Adam, who served as GCFO at Zenith Bank, it appeared the speculation had a good ground to breed on.
    The name similarity between Summit and Zenith also appeared to have given the speculators some meat to chew on.
    Summit Bank, however, later clarified its position and confirmed its operation as an independent financial entity, which is governed by a professional board.

    content: `The management of Summit Bank Ltd, Nigeria’s newest non-interest bank, has cleared the air about its existence, operations, and direction.

    summary: "With the Central Bank of Nigeria’s (CBN) updated recapitalisation deadline of 31 March 2026, Summit Bank has confirmed that it has fully met its capital requirement, positioning the bank in strong compliance with the CBN’s objective of strengthening financial stability within the Nigerian banking sector..",
    content: `With the Central Bank of Nigeria’s (CBN) updated recapitalisation deadline of 31 March 2026, Summit Bank has confirmed that it has fully met its capital requirement, positioning the bank in strong compliance with the CBN’s objective of strengthening financial stability within the Nigerian banking sector.
    As Nigeria’s newest entrant into the non-interest banking space, Summit Bank recorded a regulatory capital base of ₦15.3 billion as at 21 May 2025, a position previously confirmed by the CBN. This places the bank comfortably above the ₦10 billion minimum capital requirement for regional non-interest banks.
    Commenting on the milestone, Dr. Sirajo Salisu, Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of Summit Bank, attributed the achievement to strong stakeholder confidence and institutional leadership.
    “This milestone has been made possible by the unflinching confidence of our shareholders, the effective leadership of the Board and management team, and the dedication of our staff,” he said.
    Having achieved full capital compliance ahead of schedule, Summit Bank is now set to further strengthen its long-term commitment to operational excellence, value creation, and leadership within the ethical banking space, while supporting stakeholders for shared growth and prosperity.
    Speaking in the same vein, Dr. Mukhtar Adam, Executive Director/Chief Operating Officer, said the bank will continue to combine operational excellence with value-based banking to deliver sustainable outcomes for customers and shareholders alike.
    “With our strengthened capital base, we will continue to drive ethical and inclusive value-based banking through digital platforms, superior customer experience, and targeted lending that supports SMEs and underserved communities,” he said.
    He added that meeting the regulatory threshold is not an end in itself, but a solid foundation for the bank’s forward-looking agenda of responsible scaling, innovation within non-interest principles, and deepening partnerships that create shared economic value.
    Under the current CBN recapitalisation framework, minimum capital requirements are set at ₦500 billion for international banks, ₦200 billion for national commercial banks, ₦50 billion for regional commercial banks, ₦20 billion for national non-interest banks, and ₦10 billion for regional non-interest banks, with a deadline of 31 March 2026 for full compliance.
    Summit Bank, a purpose-driven non-interest bank, was incorporated in July 2024 and licensed by the CBN in February 2025. Positioned to deliver ethical banking services to the public, the bank aims to redefine inclusive finance through transparent products, digital accessibility, and a strong commitment to financial inclusion.
